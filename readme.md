# Coding Challenges

Every developer needs to build their skills and coding challenges are a good way to do this. This repo is an example that I provide for students to show them, 

* a sample structure for their repo, 
* demonstrate some challenges and solutions in various languages, 
* some ways of utilizing the readme.md file to make their repo's more interesting,
* the importance of comments in their code for themselves and other's reading their code, 
* methods for generating documention
* how to utilize tests for code evaluation

## Skills

In the most basic terms, a developers job is to solve problems. These problems can range from something of great scientific or national importance, through to something trivial or fun! 

The general steps that you follow are: 

1. Identify the overall problem 
2. Break it in to smaller tasks
3. Write psudeo code for tasks
4. Convert psudeo code to the programming language of your choice
5. Test 
6. Document your solution

You will often need to do steps 3-5 multiple times as there are factors that you forgot to consider and the documentation should be done throughout the coding process but often isn't :)
